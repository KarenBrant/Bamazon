# Bamazon

This is an Amazon-like application where a list of products and the price for each will be presented from a table in Sequel Pro.
An order will be taken from customers and the stock will be depleted after the order is confirmed.  Then the customer will be given
a prompt to order again.  A yes answer will take them back to the updated list and a no answer will end the application.

* The table in Sequel Pro:
